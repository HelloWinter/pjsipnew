# How to contribute

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need developers to help to maintain this project.

Before filing a bug report or pull request, please ensure that you're reporting to the correct repository!
This repository is pjsip _built for iOS/macOS_ and published on CocoaPods. If you've found a bug within pjsip itself, this is the wrong place and you'd rather go visit [pjsip.org](https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/FAQ#bug-reports).

Here are some important resources:

  * [README](https://github.com/chebur/pjsip/blob/master/README.md) tells you what this project is about,
  * [Our roadmap](https://github.com/chebur/pjsip/commits/master) is the last commits to this project
  * Bugs? [Issues](https://github.com/chebur/pjsip/issues) is where to report them

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pjsip](https://github.com/chebur/pjsip/compare) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include detailed documentation. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks, 

`pjsip` maintainers
